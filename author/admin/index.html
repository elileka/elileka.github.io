I am a postdoc with [Dr. Johannes SÃ¶ding] (https://www.mpibpc.mpg.de/soeding) at the Quantitative and Computational Biology group 
at MPIBPC.
I develop tools for the analysis of eukaryotic metagenomic data.  

Before that, I did my PhD at the departments of [Cell Research & Immunology] (https://en-lifesci.tau.ac.il/cell_research_immunology) and [Molecular Biology & Ecology of Plants] (https://en-lifesci.tau.ac.il/plant_sciences) 
at TAU under the joint supervision of [Prof. Tal Pupko] (https://m.tau.ac.il/~talp/) and [Prof. Itay Mayrose] (https://www.tau.ac.il/~itaymay/).
My work focused on statistical techniques in molecular evolution.
